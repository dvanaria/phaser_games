Learning to write games using Javascript and the Phaser framework

I got interested in learning to write games using Phaser and Javascript after
getting in touch with the company ABCYa! I asked them about how they made their
games and the told me they do web-based (browser-based) games using Javascript
and the Phaser framework.
